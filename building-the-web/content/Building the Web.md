# Building the Web

This is the documentation for the workshop: "Building the Web", written by Ludwig Wendzich.

## What you will need

* __[Presentation](HTML-CSS-Workshop)__ We've put together a presentation for this workshop, available [here](http://nzgather.github.io/HTML-CSS-Gather-Workshop/)
* __[Printouts](HTML-CSS-Workshop/assets/printable.pdf)__ This workshop includes a number of activities which require printouts. We've collated these in one pdf [here](http://nzgather.github.io/HTML-CSS-Gather-Workshop/assets/printable.pdf)

## Foundations of the Web

For a technical refresher on how HTTP and DNS works, the Web Platform Docs' "[How does the Internet work?](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/concepts/internet_and_web/how_does_the_internet_work)" is a fantastic read.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc) by Aaron Titus is a great explanation of the mechanics of the internet. It's recommended watching for instructors but not to be shown to students because of the error near the end ("candy wrapper analogy"). Same for this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj7A2YDgIWE).

## Net Neutrality

Now that we understand that the Internet isn't a cloud that everyone has free access to, but is instead a series of interconnected physical wires, it's a good time to talk about the political, ethical and economical ramifications of this fact. What are the responsibilities of the people who own the networks?

It's important to remember that in New Zealand, we're only connected to the rest of the world via one cable: the [Southern Cross Cable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Cross_Cable) and that cable is owned and controlled by Telecom. (Other owners include the Australian Optus and the American Verizon.)

## Web Standards

A "[History of the Web](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/concepts/internet_and_web/the_history_of_the_web)" is available at Web Platform Docs.

Ethan Marcotte's [Responsive Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) is essential reading for understanding web standards. He quotes [A Dao of Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/dao) by John Allsopp, clearly also influential.

## Dive into HTML / CSS Basics

We find most learning happens when we tackle specific problems. The intent of these two sections are to give a foundation for students to jump off from in their own direction.

During the afternoon session, students are asked to build their first web page. Help isn't far, the volunteers will be close by, but it gives them a chance to experience learning on their own, by playing and seeing the results in the browser.

The following cheat sheets may be useful (both are included in the printables PDF):

* [HTML](http://woorkup.com/2009/12/16/html5-visual-cheat-sheet-reloaded/)
* [CSS](http://www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/css2/)

We recommend introducing students to [Code Avengers](http://www.codeavengers.com/), a fun and effective way to review the learnings of today, expand one's understanding of the knowledge through practical examples and extend oneself further.

> **Tip:** Jump back to Thimble after covering each new idea in the HTML/CSS sections to have the students try it for themselves. Get students to use Sublime Text, or their own text editor, to create their take home website.
